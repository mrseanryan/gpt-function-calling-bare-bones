# gpt-function-calling-bare-bones README

Function Calling an LLM taking a bare-bones (no libraries) approach.

Larger LLMs can be used via Function Calling via a bare bones approach without any extra Python libraries.

This repo shows a simple example of an LLM driving a home automation system, by generating a list of function calls selected from the available functions.

The LLM is Anthropic Claude hosted on AWS Bedrock - but any reasonable quality LLM should work.
